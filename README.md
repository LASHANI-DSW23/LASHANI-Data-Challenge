# Churn Analytics Framework

## Overview

This project, developed by the Lashani Team for the Data Science Weekend 2023 Competition, aims to implement a robust churn analytics framework using machine learning and data visualizations. The goal is to identify customer segments, predict churn, estimate Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV), and provide actionable insights for personalized retention strategies.

## Methodology

### Data Collection & Preprocessing

- Gather comprehensive customer data, including patterns, demographic information, and historical interactions.
- Standardize numerical features and encode categorical variables for machine learning compatibility.

### EDA & Feature Selection

- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into feature distributions and correlations.
- Use statistical tests and domain knowledge to select relevant features for clustering and predictive modeling.

### Machine Learning Modeling

- Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to group customers based on similar characteristics.
- Develop predictive models (classification, regression) to forecast individual churn and estimate CLTV.

### Insights Generation

- Analyze results to extract impactful and actionable insights.
- Formulate personalized retention strategies for each identified customer segment.

### Deployment

- Deploy dashboard visualizations, analytics, and machine learning models using PowerBI and Streamlit.
